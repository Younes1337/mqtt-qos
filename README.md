# QoS-optimization-in-IoT-systems
Most industrial systems are now based on IoT. Therefore, ensuring the Quality of Service
(QoS) of IoT is crucial. Traditionally, IoT systems use heuristic approaches from game
theory and optimization techniques to guarantee QoS. However, these methods and
approaches present challenges whenever the number of users and devices increases or
when multicellular situations are considered. Additionally, IoT systems receive and
generate vast amounts of data that cannot be efficiently processed using traditional QoS
assurance methods, especially for extracting meaningful features from this data.

Deep Learning (DL) approaches are suggested as potential candidates to address and
manage the aforementioned challenges in order to improve and guarantee QoS in IoT. In
your project, you must explain how DL techniques can be applied to enhance the Quality
of Service in IoT. According to the literature, we note that the quality of service in IoT-
based systems is compromised when system security and confidentiality are at risk, or when IoT resources are not properly managed. Therefore, this project aims to explore how Deep Learning can be applied to improve the Quality of Service in IoT by preventing
security and confidentiality violations in these systems and ensuring appropriate and
efficient allocation and management of IoT resources.

To highlight emerging research areas related to Deep Learning and its applicability in enhancing IoT's Quality of Service and associated challenges, we will identify cutting-edge models and Deep Learning technologies. We will also identify those most commonly used to address QoS problems in IoT. We will implement DL-based algorithms to enhance QoS.
